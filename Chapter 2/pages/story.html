          <p>
            Final Fantasy XV weaves a complex tale of friendship, duty, and sacrifice set against a world on the brink of darkness, following Prince Noctis and his companions on an epic journey across Eos.

            <p>The story begins with Noctis departing Insomnia to marry Lady Lunafreya, sealing a peace treaty with the empire of Niflheim. However, during their ceremony, Niflheim betrays Lucis, invading Insomnia and stealing the Crystal, which protects the city, resulting in the death of King Regis, Noctis's father. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Grief-stricken, Noctis vows to reclaim his throne and set out to find the Royal Arms to aid him, learning that Luna is working to awaken the Astrals to help in their quest. Throughout their journey, they form alliances, face enemies, and fight trials to prove themselves worthy to the Astrals. Their path leads to Altissia, where a tragic attack leaves Luna fatally wounded, and Ignis severely injured, causing tension among the group.
            </p><br>
           <p>They ultimately face Ardyn, who reveals his true identity and motives, leading to a final confrontation where Noctis sacrifices himself to cleanse the world of the Starscourge, bringing light back to a world shrouded in darkness. In the epilogue, Noctis and Luna are united in the afterlife, symbolizing the peace their sacrifices have brought forth.
