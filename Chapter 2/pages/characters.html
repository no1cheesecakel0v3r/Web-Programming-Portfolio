            The world of Final Fantasy XV is inhabited by a diverse cast of compelling characters,
            from the steadfast heroes to the complex villains. Below you'll find information about
            the main characters who shape the destiny of Eos.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Main Characters</h>
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Noctis Lucis Caelum</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Crown Prince of Lucis | Main Protagonist</div>
              <p>
                The sole heir to the Lucian throne, Noctis embarks on a journey to reclaim his kingdom
                after it falls to imperial forces. Though he can appear aloof and moody, he deeply cares
                for his friends and the people of Lucis. Noctis possesses the power to wield various weapons
                through the Armiger, a mystical arsenal passed down through the Lucian royal family.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the Chosen King prophesied to save the world from darkness, Noctis must come to terms
                with his destiny and the sacrifices it demands. His growth from a somewhat reluctant prince
                to a determined king forms the emotional core of the story.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Gladiolus Amicitia</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Shield of the King | Sworn Protector</div>
              <p>
                Born into a family that has served as the Shield of the King for generations, Gladiolus
                (or "Gladio") takes his duty to protect Noctis very seriously. Large and imposing, he
                specializes in greatswords and acts as the group's powerhouse in battle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gladio can be stern and harsh, especially when he feels Noctis is not living up to his
                responsibilities, but this comes from a place of profound loyalty and dedication. His
                straightforward nature and unwavering resolve make him the backbone of the group.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Ignis Scientia</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Royal Advisor | Tactician</div>
              <p>
                Serving as Noctis's advisor, strategist, and caretaker, Ignis is intelligent, composed,
                and meticulous. He plans the group's tactics in battle, drives the Regalia, and even
                cooks their meals, creating new recipes from ingredients they find during their journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ignis's unwavering dedication to Noctis is tested after he loses his eyesight in Altissia,
                forcing him to adapt to his new limitations while continuing to support his king. His
                sacrifice and resilience exemplify his character's depth and commitment.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Prompto Argentum</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Crownsguard | Best Friend</div>
              <p>
                Unlike the others, Prompto wasn't born into nobility or raised to serve the crown. He
                befriended Noctis during high school, worked to improve himself, and eventually earned
                a place in the Crownsguard through perseverance and loyalty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cheerful and upbeat, Prompto lightens the mood of the group with his jokes and enthusiasm.
                He's an amateur photographer who documents their journey through his camera. Later revelations
                about his origins as a child designed to become an MT (Magitek Trooper) add complexity to his
                character as he struggles with questions of identity and belonging.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Lunafreya Nox Fleuret</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Oracle | Former Princess of Tenebrae</div>
              <p>
                Known to most as Lady Luna, she is the youngest Oracle in history, blessed with the ability
                to commune with the gods and heal those afflicted by the Starscourge. Though she was meant
                to marry Noctis as part of a peace treaty, her duty extends far beyond political arrangements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dignified, compassionate, and resolute, Luna works tirelessly to help Noctis fulfill his destiny,
                awakening the Astrals so that he may forge covenants with them. Her devotion to her calling and
                to Noctis shapes much of the game's narrative and emotional impact.

            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Ardyn Izunia</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Imperial Chancellor | Main Antagonist</div>
              <p>
                The enigmatic chancellor of Niflheim, Ardyn appears charming and helpful at first, but his true
                motives remain obscured until late in the story. His flamboyant demeanor masks a deep-seated
                bitterness and thirst for vengeance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually revealed to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, he was once a healer who absorbed daemons to save
                others, only to be rejected by the Crystal and immortalized in darkness. His complex history and
                motivations make him one of the most nuanced villains in the Final Fantasy series.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt</h3>
               <div class="character-role">Emperor of Niflheim</div>
              <p>
                The elderly ruler of the Niflheim Empire, Iedolas was once a visionary leader who sought to bring
                prosperity to his people. However, his obsession with obtaining the Crystal's power led him down a
                dark path, making him susceptible to Ardyn's manipulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the story progresses, Iedolas becomes increasingly consumed by his desire for power, eventually
                succumbing to the Starscourge and transforming into a daemon.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Ravus Nox Fleuret</h3>
               <div class="character-role">High Commander of the Imperial Army | Luna's Brother</div>
              <p>
                Luna's older brother and former prince of Tenebrae, Ravus initially serves Niflheim despite his
                hatred for the empire that conquered his homeland. His complicated feelings toward Noctis—whom he
                blames for his mother's death and the fall of Tenebrae—drive much of his character arc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, Ravus's priorities shift as he realizes the empire's true nature and his sister's
                unwavering faith in Noctis. His journey from antagonist to reluctant ally showcases the game's
                theme of redemption.

              <h3 class="character-name">Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII</h3>
               <div class="character-role">King of Lucis | Noctis's Father</div>
              <p>
                The 113th king of Lucis, Regis maintains a magical barrier around Insomnia through the power of the
                Crystal, though this takes a significant toll on his health. Knowing the prophecy that surrounds his
                son, he makes the painful decision to send Noctis away from the city before its fall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite limited screen time, King Regis's love for his son and his kingdom resonates throughout the
                narrative, particularly in his final moments and his posthumous guidance.

            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Cor Leonis</h3>
               <div class="character-role">Marshal of the Crownsguard</div>
              <p>
                Known as "The Immortal" for his legendary combat prowess and survival skills, Cor serves as a mentor
                to Noctis and his friends after the fall of Insomnia. He guides them to the royal tombs where Noctis
                can claim the power of his ancestors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stoic and dutiful, Cor represents the old guard of Lucis, maintaining his loyalty to the crown even
                after the kingdom's fall.

            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Iris Amicitia</h3>
               <div class="character-role">Gladiolus's Sister</div>
              <p>
                The younger sister of Gladiolus, Iris harbors a crush on Noctis and provides emotional support to the
                group during their visit to Lestallum. Though young, she demonstrates the same courage and resilience
                that characterize her family.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the World of Ruin, Iris becomes known as "The Daemon Slayer," fighting to protect survivors during
                the long night, showing her growth from a cheerful girl to a formidable warrior.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Cid Sophiar</h3>
               <div class="character-role">Mechanic | Former Companion of King Regis</div>
              <p>
                A gruff mechanic who once traveled with King Regis on his own journey, Cid now runs the Hammerhead
                service station with his granddaughter Cindy. He provides valuable upgrades to Noctis's weapons and
                the Regalia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though outwardly harsh, especially toward Noctis, Cid's criticism comes from concern and high expectations,
                as he sees Regis in his son.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="character-card">
              <h3 class="character-name">Cindy Aurum</h3>
              <div class="character-role">Mechanic at Hammerhead</div>
              <p>
                Cid's granddaughter and an exceptional mechanic in her own right, Cindy maintains and upgrades the Regalia
                throughout the journey. Her sunny disposition and passion for automobiles make her a memorable character
                despite limited screen time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cindy represents the resilience of the people living outside the crown city, adapting to life under imperial
                rule while maintaining their independence and spirit.
