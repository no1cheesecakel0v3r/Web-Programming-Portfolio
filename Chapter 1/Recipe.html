        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat your oven to 325ºF / 165ºC. 
            Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and sugar. 
            Press into a 9 inch baking pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beat the cream cheese and sugar until they are smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing it in at a low speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sour cream and vanilla extract together and mix well until it is blended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour half of the batter into the crust. Layer the some of the cut strawberries and then put the remaining batter on top. ( if you'd prefer strawberry jam instead, you could use that as a substitute for the middle of the cake. )
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for about 1 hour or until the center is almost set. Remove it from the oven and use a knife to unstick the dessert of the rim of the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let it cool, and then refridgerate it overnight.
          </li>

          Baking Tips

        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that all the ingredients are at room temperature before starting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't overmix the batter to prevent cracks from forming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use fresh and ripe strawberries for the best flavours possible!
