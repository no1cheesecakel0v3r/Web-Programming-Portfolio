  <h2>Development History</h2>
  <p>
    Final Fantasy XV has one of the most interesting and extended development cycles in gaming history. What eventually
    became FFXV began as a spin-off title called "Final Fantasy Versus XIII," announced in 2006 as part of the "Fabula
    Nova Crystallis" collection of games connected to Final Fantasy XIII.
  </p>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Final Fantasy Versus XIII (2006-2012)</h3>
    <p>
      Originally directed by Tetsuya Nomura, Versus XIII was intended to be a darker counterpart to Final Fantasy XIII,
      featuring a modern urban setting with fantasy elements. The game was built around the concept of a "fantasy based
      on reality" and centered on Noctis, a prince from a kingdom that controlled the world's last crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After years of minimal updates and sporadic trailers, many fans began to wonder if the game had been quietly
      canceled. Development was complicated by resource allocation issues, as Square Enix focused on completing
      Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Transition to Final Fantasy XV (2012-2016)</h3>
    <p>
      In 2012, Hajime Tabata was brought on as co-director to help move the project forward. By 2013, the decision was
      made to re-brand the game as Final Fantasy XV, elevating it from a spin-off to a mainline title. This change was
      officially announced at E3 2013, nearly seven years after the project began.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Tabata taking over as sole director, the game underwent significant restructuring. The team moved to the
      Luminous Engine, and many elements of the original concept were altered or removed to create a more focused
      experience. This transition period saw the release of the "Episode Duscae" demo in 2015, which allowed the
      developers to gather player feedback.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Release and Post-Launch Support (2016-2019)</h3>
    <p>
      After a slight delay from its original September 2016 date, Final Fantasy XV finally released on November 29, 2016,
      approximately ten years after its initial announcement as Versus XIII. The game launched alongside a multimedia
      project called "Final Fantasy XV Universe," which included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</strong> - A feature-length CG film depicting events concurrent with the game's opening</li>
      <li><strong>Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV</strong> - An anime series exploring the backstories of the main characters</li>
      <li><strong>Justice Monsters Five</strong> - A mobile game based on a minigame in FFXV</li>
      <li><strong>A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV</strong> - A retro-style beat 'em up set 30 years before the main game</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Post-release, the development team continued to support the game with updates and DLC. This included character
      episodes focused on Gladiolus, Prompto, and Ignis, as well as multiplayer expansion "Comrades." The Royal Edition,
      released in 2018, added significant new content to the game's final chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plans for additional DLC episodes were announced but later canceled when director Hajime Tabata left Square Enix
      in late 2018. Only "Episode Ardyn" was completed from this second wave of planned content, releasing in March 2019.

  <h2>Gameplay Features</h2>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Open World Exploration</h3>
    <p>
      Final Fantasy XV features a vast open world called Eos, which players can explore using the Regalia (the royal car)
      or on foot. The world includes diverse environments from deserts and wetlands to forests and mountains.
      Key locations include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Insomnia:</strong> The modern capital city of Lucis, protected by a magical barrier</li>
      <li><strong>Lestallum:</strong> A bustling city powered by the energy of a meteor</li>
      <li><strong>Altissia:</strong> A beautiful city built on water, reminiscent of Venice</li>
      <li><strong>Gralea:</strong> The imperial capital city, largely overtaken by daemons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The open world operates on a day-night cycle, with dangerous daemons appearing at night, encouraging players
      to camp or find lodging when darkness falls.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Combat System</h3>
    <p>
      Departing from the turn-based systems of earlier Final Fantasy games, FFXV features an action-based combat
      system called "Active Cross Battle" (AXB). Key aspects include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real-time combat:</strong> Players directly control Noctis while AI manages companions</li>
      <li><strong>Warp-striking:</strong> Noctis can throw his weapon and teleport to it, allowing for strategic positioning</li>
      <li><strong>Phasing:</strong> Holding the defend button allows Noctis to dodge attacks by phasing through them</li>
      <li><strong>Link-strikes:</strong> Contextual team attacks when flanking enemies with companions</li>
      <li><strong>Magic:</strong> Elemancy system allows players to craft spells by combining elements with items</li>
      <li><strong>Armiger Arsenal:</strong> Noctis can summon the royal arms of his ancestors for powerful attacks</li>
      <li><strong>Wait Mode:</strong> An optional setting that pauses action when the player stops moving, allowing for strategic planning</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Progression System</h3>
    <p>
      Characters gain experience points from battles and quests, which can be "cashed in" when resting at camps or
      lodgings. Luxurious accommodations provide experience multipliers, encouraging players to save their XP for
      premium hotels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ascension Grid allows players to spend ability points (AP) to unlock new skills and passive bonuses across
      various categories, such as combat techniques, teamwork abilities, and exploration perks.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Survival Elements</h3>
    <p>
      FFXV incorporates light survival elements that add depth to its road trip theme:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camping:</strong> Setting up camp at havens allows the party to cook meals that provide temporary stat boosts</li>
      <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Ignis can learn new recipes throughout the journey, with meals providing various buffs</li>
      <li><strong>Fishing:</strong> Noctis can fish at designated spots, catching ingredients for meals or items for quests</li>
      <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Prompto automatically takes photos during the adventure, documenting key moments</li>
      <li><strong>Regalia customization:</strong> The royal car can be upgraded and visually customized</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<section id="multimedia-project" class="content-section semi-transparent-black">
  <h2>The Final Fantasy XV Universe</h2>
  <p>
    FFXV was conceived as more than just a game—it was developed as a multimedia project spanning various formats to
    tell a complete story.
  </p>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</h3>
    <p>
      A feature-length CG film released before the game, Kingsglaive depicts the events in Insomnia during the
      signing of the peace treaty. The film follows Nyx Ulric, a member of the Kingsglaive—an elite military unit
      that draws power from King Regis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movie features the voice talents of Aaron Paul, Lena Headey, and Sean Bean. It provides crucial context
      for the game's opening and offers a closer look at characters like King Regis and Luna.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV</h3>
    <p>
      A six-episode anime series available on YouTube, Brotherhood explores the backstories of Noctis, Gladiolus,
      Ignis, and Prompto, showing how they became friends and their relationships prior to the events of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each episode focuses on a different character, providing emotional depth that enhances the player's connection
      to the main cast.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="character-card">
    <h3>DLC Episodes</h3>
    <p>
      Post-launch DLC expanded the story with episodes focusing on the supporting cast:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Episode Gladiolus:</strong> Follows Gladio as he seeks greater strength after feeling he failed Noctis</li>
      <li><strong>Episode Prompto:</strong> Explores Prompto's origins and his struggle with identity after being separated from the group</li>
      <li><strong>Episode Ignis:</strong> Reveals Ignis's sacrifice in Altissia and offers an alternate ending scenario</li>
      <li><strong>Episode Ardyn:</strong> Delves into the backstory of the main antagonist and the events that shaped him</li>
      <li><strong>Comrades:</strong> A multiplayer expansion set during the World of Ruin, where players create a custom Kingsglaive member</li>
    </ul>
